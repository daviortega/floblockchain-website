# History

PIN, formerly FLO \(The Flo Blockchain\), is in its eighth year of growth and development. It launched in 2013 as a Litecoin fork and was established to be decentralized, secure, fast and efficient. PIN's blockchain structure is derived directly from Bitcoin's UTXO model, and its security is also provided from Proof of Work. PIN was created with no pre-mine, no ICO, no master-nodes, no airdrops, and no dev-fund. It was launched fairly to all participating miners and continues to maintain this core ethos of true decentralization. As a result, its community has driven its development since its inception and continues to do so to this day.
