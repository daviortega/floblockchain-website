## What is PIN?
PIN is a proof-of-work cryptocurrency designed to save and index metadata on a decentralized, permissionless blockchain. Its unique feature—PinData—can be used to append up to 1040 bytes to any transaction and store it permanently and immutably on PIN. The PinData can then be retrieved and read by many PIN-based applications. When combined with its supporting metadata library, the Open Index Protocol ("OIP"), PIN provides a new standard for publishing, indexing, and monetizing any digital content. A robust development community is actively using PIN and PinData to create and record immutable links to the real world today.
