# What is OIP?

{% hint style="success" %}
Open Index Protocol \(OIP\) is an open source specification for a persistent worldwide index and file library useful for data publishing, file distribution and facilitating direct payments. OIP uses FLO to operate with no central authority: record indexing, file storage/distribution and transaction management are carried out collectively by the decentralized network. OIP is the first permissionless system with a decentralized and transparent index for digital content and protected file persistence. The system uses a Salutary Protocol model, which funnel financial incentive to both application and protocol layers, ensuring sustainability and antifragility of the system through open market incentive alignment of all participants. ðŸ“Œ
