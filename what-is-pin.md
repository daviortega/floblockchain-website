# What is PIN?

{% hint style="success" %}
PIN is a proof-of-work cryptocurrency designed to save and index metadata to a decentralized, permissionless network. Its unique features can be used to "pin" up to 1040 bytes to any transaction and store it permanently and immutably on the network. The pins can then be retrieved and read by many PIN-based applications. When combined with its supporting metadata library, the Open Index Protocol \("OIP"\), PIN provides a new standard for publishing, indexing, and monetizing any digital content. A robust development community is actively using PIN to create and index immutable links that will help to serve as the infrastructure for web3.ðŸ“Œ
